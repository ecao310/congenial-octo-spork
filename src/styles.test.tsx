/**
 * A CSS rule that can never match is silent. Nothing throws, nothing warns,
 * the build is green and the only symptom is a box that does not draw — which
 * is exactly how `.hint-bubble .link-note` survived: the link note's whole
 * amber treatment was typed over a hint-bubble rule and kept its prefix, so
 * from the day it landed it styled an element that has never existed.
 *
 * Scoping one class under another is the one selector shape where that
 * happens by accident, because it is the shape you get by editing the wrong
 * half of a selector you copied. So every one of them has to point at
 * something the page actually renders.
